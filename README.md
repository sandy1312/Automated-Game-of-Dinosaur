# Automated-Game-of-Dinosaur
As name suggests it is an automate dinosaur game & the idea is when cactus & Bird
come in certain Coordinate of image then dinosaur will automatically jump or down.
For this I have written simplest Python Code by using two modules i.e., PYAUTOGUI
and PILLOW that will import Image grab. Grab it will take image as Frame. As, we
know that image consists of many pixels so we will store those pixels in form of
arrays by name of data that is equal to image load. And as we have stored
coordinates in arrays. So, we will define the coordinates in code through data array
and through that if cactus & Bird will hit that coordinate then it will trigger pyautogui
keyup or keydown button automatically. This is basic idea behind Project.

**New Feature**


As Iâ€™m thinking of new idea i.e., When I say jump then dinosaur jump and when I saw down
then dinosaur down and I m thinking doing this by using speech recognition module in
python.


**Difficulties**


I found difficulty when I wanted dinosaur down when birds come for that I make another
rectangle for birds for that much amount of height if birds come then it automatically down.
For that once again I write the loop part for bird and image grab part for that.


**CONCLUSION**


I really enjoy this project because from that I gain some knowledge of module which will be
really helpful in my future.
