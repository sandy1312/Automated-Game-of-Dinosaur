# Automated-Game-of-Dinosaur
As name suggests it is an automate dinosaur game & the idea is when cactus & Bird
come in certain Coordinate of image then dinosaur will automatically jump or down.
For this I have written simplest Python Code by using two modules i.e., PYAUTOGUI
and PILLOW that will import Image grab. Grab it will take image as Frame. As, we
know that image consists of many pixels so we will store those pixels in form of
arrays by name of data that is equal to image load. And as we have stored
coordinates in arrays. So, we will define the coordinates in code through data array
and through that if cactus & Bird will hit that coordinate then it will trigger pyautogui
keyup or keydown button automatically. This is basic idea behind Project.
